# HonestClock
HonestClock is an application that helps you to track your screen time wisely.

## Progress Till Now
We have Developed the Front-End Part Completly and Working on the Back-End and Database of Application.

## Versions Of Python And Its Packages That Support HonestClock Application
<br>- Python 3.6+</br>
<br>- Kivy 2.0.0</br>
<br>- Pillow 8.4.0</br>

<br>- Database to save all informations regarding user registration.</br>
<br>- All Screens with respective buttons connecting them with one another.</br>

## Concept Behind The Application
<br>- Honest Clock has been made by using KivyMD which is a Python Package used to develop Cross-Platform Applications.</br>
<br>- Our main objective is to develop a Screen Time Management App which can run on any platform and can show the data graphically to the users, thus, will provide maximum benefit to people using it.</br>

## Things That We Are Trying To Include
<br>- Parental Control feature that will allow parents to access app usage and time spent per app data.</br>
<br>- Graphical Interpretation for better understanding.</br>
<br>- User Friendly GUI.</br>
<br>- Rescuing user's time and Focus keeper which builds motivation to complete task </br>
<br>- Feature to run in background.</br>

## Future Scopes
<br>- We can try to include Machine Learning Concepts such as Supervised Learning and Reinforcement Learning to make the application more better and more user friendly.</br>
<br>- The Application can be developed further to a social platform where people could share their productivity goals and streaks that they made by completing their goals.</br>
